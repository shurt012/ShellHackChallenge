# ShellHackChallenge

## Inspiration

As our development team consists of three young women pursuing degrees in computer science, it was not at all difficult to find inspiration and motivation to hack for the Break the Glass Ceiling Challenge. Having all dealt first-hand with the challenges that women in computing often face, we wanted to create something that we want to use. We believe that mentorship and discussion are keys to academic and professional development, and we are developing BossLadies to help girls like ourselves achieve their goals and combat discrimination, institutional challenges, and the lack of role models in the field. 

## What it does

Our project is an application that brings the primary facets of a woman in tech's life together into one user-interface. Women of all ages and backgrounds can find a place and a purpose for themselves in the BossLadies atmosphere. 

Students can tackle hardships like Impostor Syndrome by watching testimonies of those who have gone through the same. Young professionals can find mentors or conversation partners of similar interests in order to receive essential advice and guidance to grow professionally and personally. Women who have established themselves in STEM fields may offer inspiration and empowerment to those who have been weakened in the face of adversity. _Anyone_ can come to BossLadies to engage with the provided information, the other users, and the overall movement to shatter the glass ceiling as a strong, collective force.

## How we built it

* Technology Stack: Meteor.js, bootstrap, coffeescript

## Challenges we ran into

We had big dreams for this application but as time went by we had to cut down.
We wanted to store the quiz responses in mongodb, but we struggled in transferring the google sheet results 
into the database.
Another challenge was learning the meteor.js platform, since it involves referencing various variables throughout many files.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

* Beautiful UI design.
* Flawless collaboration among team members.
* Website flow that is user friendly and easy to navigate.

## What we learned

* New technology stack: mongodb and meteor.js

## What's next for B0SSLAD1ES

* Real live chat with other members of the site.
* Improved Ask Me Anything (AMA) dashboard.
* Matching algorithm for connecting mentees with mentors.
